A Graphical User Interface that is used to label/tag loaded images and videos.
This task is completed by using a pre-existing labelling/tagging method, more specifically YOLO V3 is used in this implementation.
Then, it allows the end-user to edit the initial predictions by adding a label, deleting an existing one, move or adjust the size of the bounding boxes and change the label.
Additionally, it saves the loaded images and videos in COCO format.

To execute the code follow these steps:

1) Clone the directory
2) Make sure that all the requirements in the Requirements.txt file are met
3) Download the YOLO weights from:

4) Execute the Python(version:3.7) script: gui_pyqt
